# Auto-Improvement Framework

Auto-improve gives the workflow durable evidence, bounded maintenance, strategic review, and an audit trail. It is **one system running at several agent-selected cadences** over a SQLite-backed lifecycle and impact ledger, all sharing the same **Bug / Goal** vocabulary. `builder/improve.html` is the generated, lightweight published executive journal; it is not the operational source of truth.

- **Auto-improve Gate:** reads retained evidence and decides which review modules are due, with explicit evidence/cooldowns rather than assuming a successful run proves correctness.
- **Read-only reviewers:** one ordered Workflow Review checks operational lenses; independent Strategy Auditor and Goal Advisor agents check in-strategy effectiveness and out-of-strategy headroom.
- **One Auto-improve Fixer:** consumes those findings sequentially, applies only bounded verified repairs, and records blocked or failed work honestly.
- **Goal Advisor:** proposes strategy/headroom experiments when goals are missed, the current strategy is capped, or a periodic healthy-workflow review is due. Material changes use the existing human-input approval flow.

The model is intentionally simple: run/eval/report evidence are inputs; reviewers produce Signals, Auto-improve reflects on what they mean, the Fixer applies safe Kaizen, and Goal Advisor proposes larger changes when justified.

## Two verdicts: Bug and Goal

Every run is judged on two independent axes, shown as separate pills in the Auto-improve header — never collapsed into one "health":

- **Bug** — did it *run correctly*? Errors, skipped steps, missing/empty artifacts, regressions vs the last run. Investigated by Bug Review and repaired by Auto-improve Fixer. Roughly binary.
- **Goal** — is it *achieving its success criteria*? Eval verdicts and run outputs vs `soul.md`, trended through evidence-stamped Reflection entries. Addressed by Goal Advisor proposals/experiments. Continuous.

They are orthogonal — a run can be Bug-broken while Goal-on-target, or Bug-clean while Goal-short. **Health gates goal:** a run that wasn't operationally clean produces no trustworthy goal signal, so the goal is never judged on a broken run. For routed workflows the monitor judges **only the path that ran** — a step or eval belonging to a route this run didn't take is not-applicable, never a failure.

## Files

- `soul/soul.md`: stable intent only — objective, success criteria, optional explicit user-approved constraints, and optional notification preferences. Architecture and agent assumptions are revisable and do not belong here. It stays Markdown; there is no `soul.html`.
- `db/db.sqlite`: authoritative Auto-improve finding, attempt, verification, review-artifact, module-result, finalizer, intervention, and longitudinal-impact state.
- `builder/improve.html`: the **generated Auto-improve executive journal and publishable history** — Bug/Goal verdicts, one status sentence, three Latest Auto-improve cells, and at most six material Activity transitions. It remains required, but reviewers and the Fixer read SQLite for lifecycle truth and the Auto-improve popup owns reviewer coverage, assumptions, issues, backlog counts, and complete operational detail. See `read_skill(skills=[{"name":"builder-reference","path":"references/review-improve-log.md"}])` for the render contract.
- `builder/improve-archive/YYYY-MM.html`: monthly archive files for old resolved findings and routine entries. Read only the archive files referenced by the active log's archive index or an unresolved id.
- `builder/card.health.html`: the compact per-run dashboard card the final dashboard/notify step overwrites each run (final post-check status + headline/detail in `data-*` attributes). Goal / Ikigai itself remains in `soul/soul.md`; run verdicts and progress are time-stamped in Auto-improve history.
- `route_selection.json`: which route a run took (so the monitor judges only that path).
- `runs/iteration-0`: current optimizer evidence target.

Old Markdown improve logs are **legacy**. Carry their unresolved findings into `builder/improve.html` as open-finding entries and stop writing Markdown logs. The old structured `improve-decision` JSON blocks and `F-`/`I-` ids are retired in favor of readable prose cards.

## Truth Hierarchy

Use this hierarchy when deciding what is true:

1. `soul/soul.md`: canonical stable intent. Only explicit user-approved constraints are authoritative; architecture and agent-inferred assumptions remain challengeable.
2. `runs/iteration-0/<group>/...`: current reality from actual outputs, tool logs, validation, and measurement rows.
3. Producer measurements: run-scoped, evidence-backed outcomes stored by the producing steps, plus goal observations (`get_goal_metrics`): measurement definition; fix it when it conflicts with `soul.md`.
4. `planning/plan.json`: current implementation attempt, judged against `soul.md` and iteration-0 evidence.
5. `db/db.sqlite`: durable lifecycle and impact truth for reviews, findings, fixes, verification, finalization, and comparable goal observations.
6. `builder/improve.html` + referenced archives: generated human-readable and publishable history; never use it to override SQLite lifecycle state.

## Decision Model

Auto-improve separates review from mutation. Due modules inspect in parallel where safe; one parent Fixer then applies bounded changes sequentially.

Auto-improve Fixer and Goal Advisor are the two ends of an **exploit/explore** ladder against the success-criteria definition:

- Auto-improve Fixer — **exploit: refine the current strategy.** The approach is right but execution/wiring is weak: prompts, config, validation, KB, learnings, db/report wiring, or measurement coverage need repair. It applies only findings supplied by read-only review and verifies each repair.
- Goal Advisor proposal/application — **explore: a different strategy for better success.** The current approach is **capped** — even executed cleanly it cannot satisfy the success criteria — or run evidence reveals a materially better approach. Gate selects the Goal Advisor perspective inside the normal Auto-improve Review+Fix conversation. New material strategy changes are proposal-first: create a `source="goal_advisor"` human-input request with exact intended edits, rationale, expected impact, risk, and evidence; a later Auto-improve pass applies approved changes with normal plan/config/report tools.
- Measurement improvement: measurement coverage, scoring, structured output, or validation schema is weak enough that measurement cannot be trusted — a success criterion is unmeasured, a metric duplicates Auto-improve/pre-validation, the rubric drifts, or measurement cost is out of proportion to run cost.
- No action: evidence is weak, recent changes need more runs, or the workflow is already aligned.

Each module may return multiple findings. Auto-improve keeps all material findings, but mutations remain ordered and bounded so parallel reviewers cannot race.

## Commands

- `/define-success`: confirms and normalizes Goal / Ikigai in `soul/soul.md`; it does not create a duplicate Goal/Profile card.
- `/auto-improve`: runs one complete manual Auto-improve against retained evidence without changing schedules or running the workflow.
- `/engineering-review`: runs Engineering and LLM/Ops review, consolidates the findings, then applies and verifies bounded fixes in the same agent sequence.
- The **Auto-improve** toolbar control enables the per-run review/fix pass via `post_run_monitor`.
- Goal Advisor is selected dynamically by Auto-improve Gate; no separate recurring optimizer schedule is required.

## Audit Discipline

- **Open findings** use stable human-facing IDs plus internal semantic fingerprints in SQLite. Closing or reopening happens through the finding lifecycle and attempt-scoped verification, never by editing an HTML card.
- **Human input requests are durable.** Auto-improve stores current questions in structured `report_human_inputs`; AgentWorks renders them and saves selected options and/or free-form answers. Once processed, the question, answer, outcome, and evidence are preserved as Reflection history in `builder/improve.html`. Email is a delivery channel, not the source of truth.
- **Decisions are confirmed, not assumed.** A Auto-improve Fixer or Goal Advisor decision states the effect it expects when written, and stays **unconfirmed** until a later run measures it — at which point Auto-improve stamps the decision card once: confirmed (cite before → after), no-effect/regressed (reopen a finding), or inconclusive (the run didn't exercise the changed path). A change that quietly failed is worse than no change, so it is never hidden.
- Eval-score movement is evidence, not proof. Do not claim an improvement worked until run/eval evidence supports it, and call out confounds such as small sample size, source-data drift, rubric changes, or multiple decisions in the same window. Rubric changes are the loop's biggest confound — they change what scores mean, so they go through a deliberate eval-plan-improvement pass with a major Decision card, never bundled with a harden/replan.

## Auto-improve Log Retention

`builder/improve.html` must stay readable for users and cheap for scheduled agents to load. Keep at most **six material Activity transitions** active. Move safe older resolved outcomes, superseded decisions, and routine run rows into a monthly archive `builder/improve-archive/YYYY-MM.html`; unresolved and undated history is never moved automatically. Byte size, line count, and token budgets do not trigger archiving.

**Never archive** open findings, user rules, active advisor experiments, current notes, or the latest few entries — the active Auto-improve should always answer "what's the state of this workflow right now, and what still needs attention." Archiving is append-preserving: move old detail, leave an index row, and never rewrite the meaning of an old decision.

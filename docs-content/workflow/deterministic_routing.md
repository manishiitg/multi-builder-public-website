# Deterministic Routing (route-by-file)

**Status:** Runtime deterministic-only; active workflow-plan migrations applied; caller/schedule migrations still pending
**Owners:** workflow / orchestrator
**Last updated:** 2026-06-06

## Summary

Workflow **routing steps are deterministic**: the router reads a JSON file that names the
route, and a few lines of Go pick the matching route and jump. **No LLM evaluation
inside routing.** Any judgment needed to choose a route is done *upstream* (by an
agent step or by the caller) and recorded as data in the route file.

This replaces the previous behavior, where the routing step called an LLM ("conditional
agent") to evaluate a `routing_question` and select a route — even in cases where the
decision is already fixed by a variable.

## Motivation

An audit of all workflow plans found **12 routing steps across 5 workflows**
(`upwork`, `linkedin`, `social-media`, `citymall-exploit-hacker`, `HRMS`). Of those:

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|------:|-------|
| Deterministic dispatch (switch on a variable/file) | 5 | LLM call is pure overhead |
| Terminal/chaining routers | 5 | phase-end switches; 2 are pure all-routes-to-`end` no-ops |
| Genuine LLM judgment | 2 | and even these read a file/JSON signal |

So **10 of 12 routers are not doing real LLM branching** — they're switches,
phase-chain dispatchers, or no-ops. Several already used a legacy pattern where
the routing step `description` told an agent to write `route_selection.json`,
after which the routing LLM was asked to *copy* that value into its answer. That
put the LLM in the loop for no real branching decision and forced a
`default_route_id` fallback because the copy could fumble.

The two "genuine judgment" cases collapse too: the upstream step that produced the
signal (e.g. `connection_test.json`, or a findings analysis) is the natural place to
emit the route decision as data.

**Conclusion:** routing should be a deterministic switch; judgment belongs in the
step that produces the signal.

## Design

### The routing step contract

A routing step reads one JSON route file and switches on it:

```
route file (canonical):   { "select_route": "<route_id>" }

routing step logic (pure Go, no LLM):
  1. read route_selection.json from the first available source:
     a. routing step's output dir (runner/caller preseed)
     b. declared prior-step route source
  2. find the route in routes[] whose route_id == select_route
  3. jump to that route's next_step_id
  4. if no source file exists → use default_route_id
  5. if a source file exists but value matches no route → hard error
  6. if there is no usable default → hard error (surfaced to caller)
```

The step keeps its existing shape (`routes[]`, `default_route_id`,
`next_step_id` per route). What is removed is the LLM evaluation
(`routing_question` is no longer evaluated by a model). A routing step's
`description` must be empty; any agent/probe/judgment work belongs in a prior
regular step that writes `route_selection.json`.

### Where the route file comes from (producers)

The route file is a **data sink**. Callers can preseed the router's own output
folder, while prior steps write to their own output folders and expose that file as
a declared route source.

| Producer | When | Who decides |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **`run_workflow` / `run_step` param** | Caller already knows the flow | the caller; orchestrator writes the router's own route file |
| **A prior agent step** | The route needs judgment | the prior step writes a route file in its own output folder |
| **Builder / plan default** | A fixed default baked into the plan | the plan author |
| _(none)_ → `default_route_id` | No source file exists | fallback |

### Precedence

```
1. run_workflow / run_step param          (caller's explicit choice — wins)
2. routing step's own route_selection.json        (caller-preseeded file)
3. declared prior-step route source               (agent judgment)
4. default_route_id                        (only when no route file exists)
→ if an explicit value is present but invalid → error (no silent default)
```

### `run_workflow` / `run_step` / `run_full_workflow` parameter

`run_workflow`, `run_step`, and the workshop builder's `run_full_workflow`
tool have an **optional** `route_selections` parameter. The runner carries that
map into execution options; the workflow controller pre-seeds route files after
run-folder/group resolution and cleanup, before the first step executes.

```jsonc
run_workflow(
  workflow_path   = "Workflow/upwork",
  group_name      = "default",
  route_selections = { "route-by-mode": "search" }   // new, optional
)
```

- Shape: `route_selections : { <routing_step_id> : <route_id | next_step_id> }`
  — a map, so workflows with multiple routers (and chaining) are supported.

### Value resolution (route_id vs destination step_id)

The value may name **either** the abstract `route_id` **or** the route's
`next_step_id` (the destination step). The runner resolves and validates:

```
value matches a route_id in that step's routes[]              → use it
else value matches exactly one next_step_id in that step's routes[] → use that route
else value matches multiple next_step_id entries              → error (ambiguous)
else → error (not a valid route for this router)
```

- **Primary form is `route_id`** (stable semantic label; survives step renames).
- `next_step_id` is accepted as an alias only when it maps to exactly one route.
- Either way the value is validated to be **one of that router's declared routes** —
  so this is a real branch, never an arbitrary `goto`.
- On disk we always normalize to the canonical `route_id`:
  `{ "select_route": "<route_id>" }`.

## Runtime changes implemented

| Layer | Change |
|-------|--------|
| `controller_routing.go` (`executeRoutingStep`) | Replaced the `conditionalAgent.EvaluateRouting(...)` call path with deterministic file/default resolution. The branch selection is now "read file → validate → switch"; routing descriptions are rejected. |
| `controller_routing_deterministic.go` | Added the deterministic resolver, route value normalization, prior-step source lookup, and `route_selections` pre-seeding. |
| `workflow_run_tools.go` (`run_workflow`, `run_step`) | Added optional `route_selections` to the tool schemas and parser. No scalar `route` sugar was added. |
| `planning_exports.go` (`run_full_workflow`) | Added optional `route_selections` so the workflow builder can select fixed branches from the user's chat request without adding a redundant `human_input` step. |
| `runWorkflowInternal` / server request path | Parses `route_selections` and carries it through `execution_options`; file writing happens later because final group run folders are resolved during execution. |
| execution controller / batch setup | Validates `route_selections` against each router's `routes[]`, then writes `route_selection.json` into each routing step's output dir after cleanup and before step execution. |
| routing source resolution | Checks the router's own preseeded route file first, then `route_source_file`, then `context_dependencies` entries named `route_selection.json`, preserving folder ownership. |
| `routing.md` guidance | Rewritten: routing is a deterministic switch; judgment goes in an upstream step or the caller; document the file contract and `route_selections`. |
| active workflow plans | Migrated active `upwork`, `social-media`, `linkedin`, `HRMS`, and `citymall-exploit-hacker` plans away from routing-step LLM classification. Variable-mode routers now expect caller `route_selections`; judgment routers consume producer-owned `route_selection.json`. |

`conditional_agent.go` still contains the old routing helper code for now, but runtime
workflow routing no longer calls it. That cleanup can be done separately after any
direct helper tests or legacy references are removed.

The loop-guard in `controller_execution.go` (a route may be selected at most twice
before an "infinite loop" error) is unaffected and still bounds backward-jump loops.

## Migration

### upwork

Active `upwork` plan migration is applied.

1. Drop the routing **LLM** (deterministic read replaces it).
2. `route-by-mode`: the `FLOW_MODE` variable and legacy routing description that copied it
   into the file are replaced by the `run_workflow` `route_selections` param (the runner
   writes the file). Remove `FLOW_MODE` from `variables/variables.json` groups.
3. Repoint upwork's schedules from "group with `FLOW_MODE=search`" to
   `route_selections = { "route-by-mode": "search" }`.
4. Verify: `route_selections={"route-by-mode":"search"}` runs the search block;
   omitting the param falls back to `default_route_id` (`profile`).

### Other plans

- `social-media`: browser preflight now writes `route_selection.json`; run-mode
  routing expects caller `route_selections`.
- `linkedin`, `HRMS`: variable-driven dispatchers now expect caller
  `route_selections`.
- `citymall/review-and-expand`: the upstream analysis step writes
  `{ "select_route": "..." }` in its own output folder, and the routing step reads
  that file through an explicit `route_selection.json` dependency.
- Pure all-routes-to-`end` terminators: out of scope here, but they should be
  collapsed to a plain end/regular step rather than a routing step.

### Migrating another laptop / workspace

Workflow plan files under `workspace-docs/Workflow/.../planning/plan.json` may be
local workspace state, not git-tracked source. Another laptop must have **both**
the new runtime code and migrated local plan JSON.

1. **Update the runtime code first.** Pull/deploy the code that includes
   deterministic routing and `route_selections`. Old runtime code will ignore the
   new contract and still try to LLM-evaluate routing.
2. **Find active routing steps.**

   ```bash
   find workspace-docs/Workflow -path '*/planning/plan.json' -print \
     | xargs jq -r '
       input_filename as $file
       | .steps[]?
       | select(.type == "routing")
       | [$file, .id, .title, (.description // ""), (.default_route_id // "")]
       | @tsv'
   ```

3. **Migrate variable routers to caller `route_selections`.** Remove routing-step
   descriptions that read variables like `FLOW_MODE`, `RUN_MODE`, or
   `WORKFLOW_MODE`. Keep the router deterministic (`description: ""`) and pass the choice
   when starting the workflow:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "route_selections": {
       "route-by-mode": "search",
       "step-run-mode-router": "propose_new",
       "step-workflow-router": "route-post",
       "workflow-mode-router": "route-monthly"
     }
   }
   ```

   Use only the routing steps present in that workflow run. Values may be either a
   route's `route_id` or a unique `next_step_id`; `route_id` is preferred.

4. **Migrate judgment routers to producer-owned files.** The prior step that makes
   the decision must be a normal step before the routing step. It writes
   `route_selection.json` in its own output folder and declares it in
   `context_output`:

   ```json
   {
     "context_output": "analysis.json, route_selection.json"
   }
   ```

   The routing step then consumes only that route file:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "routing",
     "context_dependencies": ["route_selection.json"]
   }
   ```

   The file body must be:

   ```json
   { "select_route": "<route_id>" }
   ```

5. **Update schedules/callers.** Any cron, script, or saved run config that used
   variables for route choice must pass `route_selections` instead:

   | Old variable | New route selection |
   |--------------|---------------------|
   | `FLOW_MODE=search` | `{ "route-by-mode": "search" }` |
   | `RUN_MODE=propose_new` | `{ "step-run-mode-router": "propose_new" }` |
   | `VAR_RUN_MODE=engage` | `{ "step-workflow-router": "route-engage" }` |
   | `WORKFLOW_MODE=monthly` | `{ "workflow-mode-router": "route-monthly" }` |

6. **Validate the migrated workspace.**

   ```bash
   find workspace-docs/Workflow -path '*/planning/plan.json' -print \
     | xargs jq empty
   ```

   Then run a structural route check:

   ```bash
   node <<'NODE'
   const fs = require("fs");
   const { execSync } = require("child_process");
   const files = execSync("find workspace-docs/Workflow -path '*/planning/plan.json' -print", { encoding: "utf8" })
     .trim()
     .split("\n")
     .filter(Boolean);
   let errors = [];
   const matchesOutput = (output, dep) => String(output || "").split(",").map(s => s.trim()).includes(dep);
   for (const file of files) {
     const steps = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file, "utf8")).steps || [];
     const ids = new Set(steps.map(s => s.id).filter(Boolean));
     for (let i = 0; i < steps.length; i++) {
       const step = steps[i];
       if (step.type !== "routing") continue;
       const routes = step.routes || [];
       const routeIDs = new Set(routes.map(r => r.route_id));
       if (String(step.description || "").trim()) errors.push(`${file}: ${step.id} must clear routing description`);
       if (routes.length < 2) errors.push(`${file}: ${step.id} has fewer than 2 routes`);
       if (step.default_route_id && !routeIDs.has(step.default_route_id)) errors.push(`${file}: ${step.id} invalid default_route_id`);
       for (const route of routes) {
         if (route.next_step_id !== "end" && !ids.has(route.next_step_id)) {
           errors.push(`${file}: ${step.id}/${route.route_id} points to missing ${route.next_step_id}`);
         }
       }
       if ((step.context_dependencies || []).includes("route_selection.json")) {
         const hasProducer = steps.slice(0, i).some(s => matchesOutput(s.context_output, "route_selection.json"));
         if (!hasProducer) errors.push(`${file}: ${step.id} depends on route_selection.json but no prior producer declares it`);
       }
     }
   }
   if (errors.length) {
     console.error(errors.join("\n"));
     process.exit(1);
   }
   console.log("routing plan validation passed");
   NODE
   ```

7. **Smoke-test one route per migrated workflow.** For example:

   ```jsonc
   run_workflow("Workflow/upwork", "default", route_selections={ "route-by-mode": "search" })
   run_workflow("Workflow/social-media", "default", route_selections={ "step-run-mode-router": "propose_new" })
   run_workflow("Workflow/linkedin", "default", route_selections={ "step-workflow-router": "route-engage" })
   run_workflow("Workflow/HRMS", "default", route_selections={ "workflow-mode-router": "route-monthly" })
   ```

   If a workflow has a preflight/judgment router, confirm the producer step writes
   `route_selection.json` before the router runs.

## Decisions made

1. **File name / field.** Canonical file is `route_selection.json` with
   `select_route`. Compatibility aliases `route_id` and `selected_route_id` are
   accepted. Values are normalized to route IDs.
2. **JSON file always.** Routing never reads variables directly. Caller overrides are
   written as `route_selection.json` by the runner.
3. **Keep `routing_question`.** It remains for compatibility and plan readability,
   but it is not evaluated by a model.
4. **No scalar `route` sugar.** Use the explicit `route_selections` map:
   `{ "<routing_step_id>": "<route_id | next_step_id>" }`.

## Remaining follow-ups

1. Migrate callers/schedules that currently pass routing variables (for example
   `FLOW_MODE`, `RUN_MODE`, or `WORKFLOW_MODE`) to `route_selections`.
2. Collapse pure all-routes-to-`end` terminators where they add no real branch.
3. Optionally remove the now-unused routing LLM helper path from `conditional_agent.go`
   after checking direct tests and legacy callers.

## Example (end to end)

```jsonc
// caller
run_workflow("Workflow/upwork", "default", route_selections={ "route-by-mode": "search" })

// runner (before execution) writes:
//   runs/<run>/execution/route-by-mode/route_selection.json
//   { "select_route": "search" }

// routing step "route-by-mode" (deterministic):
//   reads select_route = "search"
//   routes[]:  search → next_step_id "search-scrape-jobs"
//   → jumps to search-scrape-jobs; runs the search block

// no param next time? → falls back to default_route_id ("profile")
```

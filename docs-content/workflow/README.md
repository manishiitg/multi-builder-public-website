# Workflow Docs

These docs cover workflow design, execution, and workflow-scoped runtime behavior.

## Includes

- Canvas and workflow UX
- Running workflows and workflow manifests
- Step configuration and execution modes
- Learning, evaluation, and monitoring
- Workflow-only interaction patterns such as human feedback and `todo_task`

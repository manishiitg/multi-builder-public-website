# Workflow Builder Commands And Tools

This document is a compact reference for the current workflow-builder surface. The canonical slash-command prose lives in `agent_go/cmd/server/guidance/templates/`; do not duplicate those templates here.

## Core Model

Workflow improvement has three layers:

- **Intent + plan**: `soul/soul.md` defines stable objective/success criteria and explicit user constraints; `planning/plan.json` defines the current, revisable implementation attempt.
- **Eval**: `evaluation/evaluation_plan.json` plus per-run reports. This measures success-criteria achievement (operational quality is Pulse triage's per-run job).
- **Goal card**: the per-criterion Met/Short/At-risk card in `builder/improve.html`, maintained agentically by Pulse from eval reports + `soul.md`. It is the durable goal signal over runs; there is no separate numeric metrics layer.

Optimizer actions are deliberately small in number:

- `Pulse Bug Review/Fixer(group_name?, focus?)`: use when the workflow path is basically right, but prompts, config, validation, KB, learnings, db/report wiring, or eval coverage need repair. It should delete stale `learnings/{step-id}/main.py` for `code_exec` steps and only patch `main.py` for `learn_code`.
- Goal Advisor proposals and experiments: use for Goal recovery, a capped strategy, or periodic healthy 10x/headroom review. Scheduled Pulse starts this through `run_goal_advisor_review(...)`; material plan changes are proposed through `create_human_input_request(source="goal_advisor", ...)` and later applied with normal plan/config/eval/report tools only after approval. `builder/improve.html` holds at most one active `.advisor-experiment` card, which preserves the current baseline and advances through proposal, approval, running, measurement, and a terminal adopted/rejected/retired outcome. Pulse schedules the next meaningful checkpoint instead of generating bold ideas every run.
- Eval-plan improvement: use when eval coverage, scoring, structured output, or validation schema is weak enough that measurement cannot be trusted, or eval cost is out of proportion to run cost.

All plan/design reviews and KB/learnings/DB/eval/report/workflow improvement commands load the shared `assumption-audit` reference. It prevents repeated agent-written choices from becoming accidental constraints: explicit user constraints and verified external facts are preserved; current design choices remain revisable; unsupported assumptions are corrected within command boundaries or surfaced once under Pulse's **Assumptions challenged** for Goal Advisor/user judgment.

## Workshop Modes

- `builder`: creates and debugs workflow structure. Builder defaults steps to `code_exec`; learn-code promotion belongs to Optimizer only after explicit user request, deterministic behavior, and 10+ scenario-covering successful runs.
- `optimizer`: improves existing workflows from `runs/iteration-0`, eval reports, logs, and `builder/improve.html`.
- `run`: user-facing runtime for Slack/WhatsApp and normal operation. It can answer directly from workflow state, read KB/learnings/db/run artifacts, execute normal or orphan utility steps, or run the full workflow. It should not mutate plan/config/eval/report definitions; durable user-owned runtime context is captured through `capture_context`.
- Reporting authoring is available in Builder and Optimizer through report-plan tools. The legacy Reporting mode remains for compatibility.

## Guidance Tool

Slash commands are one-line UI shortcuts that call:

```text
get_workflow_command_guidance(kind="...", focus?)
```

The returned guidance is the source of truth for the command. Mode validation lives in the guidance registry. Slash-command callers should pass the conversation or request text before the slash command as `focus`, so guidance can apply the user's recent constraints and "based on what we just discussed" intent.

Current guidance kinds:

```text
design-plan
ready-to-optimize
review-plan
review-speed
review-cost
review-code
review-artifact-drift
improve-knowledge
improve-learnings
improve-data
define-success
improve-evaluation
auto-improve
improve-report
```

## Key Slash Commands

| Command | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/design-plan` | Builder | Design step flow and context handoffs. |
| `/ready-to-optimize` | Builder | Check whether the workflow is ready to hand to Optimizer. |
| `/review-plan` | Builder, Optimizer, Run | Structural and artifact-sync review through `review_plan`. |
| `/review-code` | Optimizer | Review all saved code artifacts, including learn-code scripts and eval code. |
| `/review-artifact-drift` | Builder, Optimizer | Audit whether learnings, code, KB, db, reports, and eval wiring drifted from recent plan changes. |
| `/review-speed` | Optimizer | Review latency and safe speedups. |
| `/review-cost` | Optimizer | Review cost and safe reductions. |
| `/improve-knowledge` | Builder, Optimizer | Improve knowledgebase notes with targeted cleanup or cross-step consolidation. |
| `/improve-learnings` | Builder, Optimizer | Improve global learnings with targeted cleanup or current-plan consolidation. |
| `/improve-data` | Builder, Optimizer | Improve durable data contracts, schemas, and report compatibility. |
| `/define-success` | Optimizer | Confirm the goal, write the workflow profile, and seed the Pulse goal card. |
| `/improve-evaluation` | Optimizer | Improve evaluation coverage and rubric quality. |
| `/auto-improve` | Optimizer | Create/update frequent Run-mode and Optimizer-mode schedules. |
| `/improve-report` | Builder, Optimizer | Improve report layout, color, density, and widget/data wiring. |

## Continuous Improvement Cadence

Pulse is the single recurring maintenance loop. Its Gate decides which review modules are due, and its parent Pulse Fixer applies bounded verified changes.

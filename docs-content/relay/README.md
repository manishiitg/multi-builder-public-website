# Relays

A Relay is a fixed chain of agents you run from anywhere: JSON in, agents and
scripts do the work, JSON out. You describe what you want in a Builder chat,
test the draft, then publish versioned releases (`v1`, `v2`, …) that stay
stable while you keep editing.

## How one call flows

<div class="sec-flow">
<div class="sec-box"><b>1. Call</b><span>POST your function, input JSON, and an idempotency key. Empty version means the active release.</span></div>
<div class="sec-arrow">→</div>
<div class="sec-box"><b>2. Run pinned</b><span>The run executes that release's frozen snapshot — later publishes can't change it mid-flight.</span></div>
<div class="sec-arrow">→</div>
<div class="sec-box hi"><b>3. Poll result</b><span>GET the run until it completes. The response carries the JSON result plus the version that ran.</span></div>
</div>

Repeat an idempotency key and you get the original run back (`duplicate:
true`), even after newer releases publish. Reuse a key with *different* input
and the API refuses with 409 — keys are promises, not suggestions.

## Drafts vs releases

| | Draft | Release (v1, v2, …) |
|---|---|---|
| Lives in | Your editable workspace | A frozen, checksummed snapshot |
| Changes when | You edit in the Builder | Never — publish mints a new one |
| Runs via | Builder tests | API calls (active, or a pinned older one) |
| On failure | You see it in chat and fix it | Fails visibly with the step and reason |

Publishing requires a valid graph: a final output agent producing JSON, at
least one enabled function with a required object `INPUT`, and saved code for
every script step. Only owners and editors can publish. Users with Relay visibility can invoke permitted API functions.

## What's inside a Relay

<div class="sec-lanes">
<div class="sec-lane"><h4>Agents</h4>Authored prompts that read the caller's JSON (<code>{{input}}</code>), use tools and skills, and must return valid JSON.</div>
<div class="sec-lane"><h4>Scripts</h4>Strict Python steps with saved code. A script failure stops the run — no retries, no repairs.</div>
<div class="sec-lane"><h4>Branches</h4>Deterministic routes on JSON values. Every route must reach the output agent; no loops or joins.</div>
</div>

External products invoke Relays through authenticated API function triggers.
Cron/calendar schedules, Slack, WhatsApp, bot chats, and Auto-improve are not supported.
Authorized Google apps remain available to agents.

## API reference

All calls are authenticated the same way as the rest of the API.

**Start a run** — `POST /api/relays/{id}/runs`

```json
{
  "function": "greet",
  "input": { "name": "Ada" },
  "idempotency_key": "order-8842-attempt-1",
  "version": "v1"
}
```

`version` is optional and defaults to the active release. Returns `202`:

```json
{
  "run_id": "b28e48e9-…",
  "status": "running",
  "version": "v1",
  "duplicate": false,
  "poll_url": "/api/relays/wf_bb882752/runs/b28e48e9-…"
}
```

**Poll a run** — `GET /api/relays/{id}/runs/{run}`

Returns the run status while it works, and the output agent's JSON plus
`version` once complete. Unknown runs and other people's runs both answer
404 — the API never confirms what you may not see.

**List releases** — `GET /api/relays/{id}/releases`

Returns the active version and every published release with its content hash.

## Limits to know

- Snapshots hold UTF-8 text only (50 MiB / 5000 files). Binary assets are
  outside the release contract.
- A crashed run ends honestly as `interrupted` and stays pollable — but it
  never resumes mid-chain. Don't describe Relays as resumable.
- A release whose files change after publishing fails its checksum and stops
  serving until you republish. Runs should only write inside their run folder.

## Platform MCP authoring and execution

Relay tools are admitted by `product.yaml` under
`chat.builder.external_tools`. There is no Relay Run-chat mode.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `create_relay` | Create an owned draft, an object `INPUT`, a default variable group, and an enabled function trigger |
| `builder_chat` | Edit the graph, exact prompts, message sequences, per-step models, and custom Python tool source through the existing Builder |
| `builder_status`, `builder_reply_input`, `builder_cancel` | Poll, answer, or cancel that Builder operation |
| `update_relay` | Rename the draft or change its designated output agent |
| `test_relay` | Execute the draft with sample JSON input |
| `get_relay_releases`, `publish_relay` | Inspect or freeze immutable versions using the existing publisher |
| `run_relay` | Execute an explicit published version, or the active version when omitted |
| `get_relay_run` | Poll the durable run ID and retrieve status, final JSON, and step outputs |

Deployment must enable `AGENTWORKS_MCP_BUILDER_ENABLED=true` to expose authoring.
An OAuth client must explicitly request `relays:write workflows:read files:read
runs:execute`; Relay authoring is **not** included in default connection scopes.
PATs use the same scopes and workflow bounds. To create new Relays, the grant
must cover all accessible workflows (`all_workflows=true`), and the account must
have create rights and Relay product access. A selected-ID grant edits only the
selected Relays. `relays:write` does not authorize AgentWorks Builder editing.
Existing scoped `builder:chat` grants may edit/publish selected Relays when the
account also has Relay product access. Owner/editor access is checked live.
Read access plus `runs:execute` permits published execution, never draft testing.

Use `get_api_spec` to discover this connection's actual tools and schemas before
calling them. IDs come from `list_workflows` (inspect `manifest.kind=relay`) or
`create_relay`, never filesystem paths. For example, these are **call_tool**
arguments:

```json
{"name":"create_relay","arguments":{"label":"Hello","submission_id":"hello-create-1"}}
```

Creation returns `workflow_id`, an owned manifest, default output agent ID
`answer`, and function `process`. Send `builder_chat` a request to build that
agent with authored system/user prompts and JSON output; use a unique
`submission_id` and poll its `operation_id` with `builder_status`. Source-file
editing uses the shared managed file tools with revision checks and audit.
External Builder retains its existing restrictions on shell, account tools,
and connected-account access; execution uses the existing step sandbox.

```json
{"name":"test_relay","arguments":{"workflow_id":"<returned ID>","function":"process","input":{"name":"Asha"},"idempotency_key":"sample-1"}}
{"name":"publish_relay","arguments":{"workflow_id":"<returned ID>"}}
{"name":"run_relay","arguments":{"workflow_id":"<returned ID>","function":"process","version":"v1","input":{"name":"Asha"},"idempotency_key":"production-1"}}
{"name":"get_relay_run","arguments":{"workflow_id":"<returned ID>","run_id":"<returned run ID>"}}
```

Creation retries with the same grant/submission ID return the original Relay;
conflicting arguments fail. Creation reservations are in private auth state.
Run retries preserve the original input/version after republishing; conflicting
input fails. Draft-test keys are separate from published-run keys. Each response
returns a `run_id`; polling is caller-bound and follows current access grants.
Draft tests have an empty version; published results identify their frozen
version. Large outputs retain the existing artifact-link behavior.
